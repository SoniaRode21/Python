For the graph1.txt, the output is the shortest possible way to reach the exit from all the nodes.
If two or more ways are present, the shortest way is chosen for exit.

For test case 1 :
    Test one checks if the exit node is conneceted to the graph, i.e reachable by
    any of the nodes present on the graph.
    for 5 5 5, the exit row will be 5 which is not connected to the graph.Thus there
    is no exit path from any of the nodes.

For test case 2 :
    In the test only rocks are present, in this case you can not move forward,
    thus  exit is not  possible.

For test case 3 :
    In the third case, a rock is present in front of the exit so you can not exit.
    i.e the exit node is not reachable through the graph

These test cases check the code for edge cases which might break the code.
